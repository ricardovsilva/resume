He has knowledge and experience with a great variety of languages and technologies, such as, but not limited to, Ruby (Rails, Sinatra and Jekyll), .NET, Python (with Django, Flask, Scrapy) and others.</br>
Ricardo is totally capable to design and develop from simple systems to high available distributed systems. For example Restful API based systems (with Rails, Sinatra, Nancy, Express, Flask and others).</br>
Ricardo easily exchanges free time for more time to learn or develop, and he is always learning new technologies, such as participating of Open Source community. Speaking in Open Source, he loves the Open Source way, the history and the philosophy behind each project, and have done a few contributions with some open repositories. Also, loves Python language and Python community. This means that he can easily, and prefer, work with a Linux environment (today he still just using windows because he love games too).</br>
Definetly, his strongest point is his overview about the entire process of a software development, including the architecture of systems, cloud, team management, SCRUM and good programming practices.</br>
