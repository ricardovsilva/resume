Ricardo is a System Architect and Full Stack developer that loves develop. He has knowledge and experience with a great variety of languages and technologies, such as .NET environment, Ruby (with Rails, Sinatra and Jekyll frameworks), Python (with Django, CherryPy, Scrapper and PyGame frameworks), and others (and he never stop learning new technologies).
Ricardo easily exchanges free time for more time to learn or develop, and he is always learning new technologies, such as participating of Open Source community. Speaking in Open Source, Ricardo loves the Open Source way, the history and the philosophy behind each project, and have done a few contributions with some open repositories. Also, Ricardo loves Python language and Python community. This means that he can easily, and prefer, work with a Linux environment (today he still just using windows because he love games too).</br>
